# Learning React with a portfolio

I came across [caljrimmer's](https://github.com/caljrimmer) "Portfolio Redux App" and thought it would be a fun project to work on while getting to understand how react and redux worked a little bit more. It was also a good excersize because my actual portfolio site could use some love. I was able to learn some of the ins and outs of working with react while also hammering otu some details on how I wanted to update my own site.
